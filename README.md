I built this cocktail app that consumes the cocktail API. This app basically showsa variety of cocktails availble.
It gives users access to filter through and search for a specific cocktail.
It also display specicfically selected cocktails.
This was an exciting project that has helped me understand so many React concepts.

My next projects calls, I gotta go!!!
