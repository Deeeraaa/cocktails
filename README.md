I built this cocktail app which consumes the cocktail API from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=. 
This app basically shows a variety of cocktails available.
It gives users access to filter through and search for a specific cocktail.
It also display specicfically selected cocktails.
This was an exciting project that has helped me understand so many React concepts.

My next projects calls, I gotta go!!!
